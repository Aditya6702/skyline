# Blockchain Flight Maintenance System

## Overview

This project aims to decentralize the flight maintenance system by utilizing blockchain technology. The primary objectives include ensuring the originality of aircraft, recording its complete history, and preventing data tampering through the use of blockchain. Additionally, the project incorporates AI for text-to-text and image-to-text responses, providing an interactive and decentralized interface for various users. Each user is granted different functionalities, and the system features responsive user interfaces for diverse devices. Users can also track live flight traffic through API calls.

## Features

### 1. Blockchain Technology

- **Originality Verification:** Utilize blockchain to verify the originality of aircraft by storing relevant details in an immutable ledger.
  
- **Complete History:** Record and secure the complete history of each aircraft, ensuring transparency and traceability.

- **Data Tamper-Resistance:** Leverage blockchain's tamper-resistant nature to prevent unauthorized modifications to the stored data.

### 2. AI Integration

- **Text-to-Text Responses:** Implement AI for text-based interactions, allowing users to query and receive responses regarding flight maintenance.

- **Image-to-Text Responses:** Utilize AI to process images and extract relevant information, enhancing the system's capabilities.

### 3. Decentralized Interfaces

- **User-Specific Functionalities:** Provide different functionalities for each user type within the decentralized system, ensuring tailored experiences.

- **Responsive UI:** Implement an interactive user interface that adapts to various screen sizes and devices for a seamless user experience.

### 4. Live Flight Traffic Tracking

- **API Integration:** Enable users to track live flight traffic using API calls, enhancing real-time monitoring capabilities.
